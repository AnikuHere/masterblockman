# masterblockman by DeniusGG
 A big package for big ambitions

# What is "masterblockman"
 It is a repository that includes version1 and version2 of the "blockman engine" found in BlockmanGo. These files include game maps, engines, icons, and essential API and server files.

 # How to use
  1) The file "BlockmanVercel", is from my seperate repository. This folder contains all the software related to servers. It stores accounts, game information, clan information, and many more. This is where you will manage the client API from. 
  2) File "Compiled BedWars" - contains a full recreation of BedWars minigame
  3) BG Engine 1: Main folder which contains the main logic of the game
  4) BG Game Server Compiled: testing grounds for your games, packed with " Game Server " for local play and host
  5) Mobclient-ultraG: The code for the mobile client, usually paired up with BG Engine 1 for the game logic and BlockmanVercel for API & server
  6) BMWeb: An abandoned attempt to make a web version of the mobile client. It was going to be intended for PC and older mobile devices.
  7) Engine 2: a lesser resource demaning version of engine 1: only recommended if you want more control over visuals (lesser blocky models, because importing them in engine1 causes a lot off issues)


# Set up:

 For API's and servers, you can use the BlockmanVercel file. Try hosting it on either Vercel (recommended), Linux (also recommended for full control), or Netlify ( may be unoptimized )

 For the main game logic (Creating the game world itself) use BG Engine 1. Also possible to link BedWars files aswell

 For getting started on a web client, even as a concept, consider BMweb

 For making the client where users can login and enter worlds, use MobClient-UltraG


 # Folders missing?

  Alternativly, you can download it from the releases page


  # Whats gonna be in the future?

   A game editor for the engine, it will not be perfect or good, but it will be functional. It will be good for beginners in the BG engine or programming entirely. I'm gonna call it "BMENG Editor" or something. No ideas in mind right now,


   # Is this malware

   I have no intentions of that kind. I am simply publishing what i have found and compiled over the years, since it is possible for me to lose these files.

   # Are contributions and forks allowed?

   1) If you make a pull request, it is a very low chance for me to accept. i have a busy life, and also, there are many files in the repository. There is a small chance someone puts malware somewhere. If you find any malicious material inside the folders, please alert me.

   2) Yes, forks are allowed, as long as you make proper credits to this project .
