# masterblockman by DeniusGG
 A big package for big ambitions

# What is "masterblockman"
 It is a repository that includes version1 and version2 of the "blockman engine" found in BlockmanGo. These files include game maps, engines, icons, and essential API and server files.

 # How to use
  1) The file "BlockmanVercel", is from my seperate repository. This folder contains all the software related to servers. It stores accounts, game information, clan information, and many more. This is where you will manage the client API from. 
  2) File "Compiled BedWars" - contains a full recreation of BedWars minigame
  3) BG Engine 1: Main folder which contains the main logic of the game
  4) BG Game Server Compiled: testing grounds for your games, packed with " Game Server " for local play and host
  5) Mobclient-ultraG: The code for the mobile client, usually paired up with BG Engine 1 for the game logic and BlockmanVercel for API & server
  6) BMWeb: An abandoned attempt to make a web version of the mobile client. It was going to be intended for PC and older mobile devices.



# Set up:

 For API's and servers, you can use the BlockmanVercel file. Try hosting it on either Vercel (recommended), Linux (also recommended for full control), or Netlify ( may be unoptimized )

 For the main game logic (Creating the game world itself) use BG Engine 1. Also possible to link BedWars files aswell

 For getting started on a web client, even as a concept, consider BMweb

 For making the client where users can login and enter worlds, use MobClient-UltraG
